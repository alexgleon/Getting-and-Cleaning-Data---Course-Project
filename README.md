# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project
My Solution to Week 4 Peer Graded Asignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Solution Summary:
1)At the bottom you can find a link to the data source.
2)Download the data into your working directory.
3)The run_analysis.R code that can be sourced in Rstudio to overview the solution
4)In line 15 remember to set the working directory, the "UCI HAR Dataset" must exists in that directory for the solution to work.
5)A scnd_TidySet.txt is generated in your working directory as the final step of this solution 

## How does the solution Work?
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Adiyional Info
You can find a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
