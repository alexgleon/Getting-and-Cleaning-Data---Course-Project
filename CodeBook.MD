### Overview
This file contains aditional info useful to understand the source, coding and output for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

## What is in the text files
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

## How is the solution achieved
## Part 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, asigning the column names 
  - reading the test files
      - X_test.txt
      - y_test.txt
      - subject_test.txt
  - reading the train files
    - X_train.txt
    - y_train.txt
    - subject_train.txt
  - reading features and activity  
    - features.txt
    - activity_labels.txt
      
## Part 2 Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Get column names for activity, Id, subject, mean, std, then create a subset "finalset_mean_std" that contains TRUE for mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the other.

## Part 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset "finalset_mean_std" with the "activity_labels" table to inlude the descriptive activity names.

## Part 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
This was already achieved by steps Reading testing sets, Reading feature and activity sets and Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set steps in the code

## Part 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
The final instructions were to create a second data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject
